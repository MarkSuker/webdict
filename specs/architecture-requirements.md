General architectural quality
-----------------------------
- Meets all the requirements?
- Anything over-architected?
- Anything under-architected?
- Good overall harmony, ergonomy?
- Top-level design independent of the machine and language?
- Motivations for major decisions provided?
- Are you comfortable to implement the architecture?


Upstream prerequisites
----------------------
- Have you identified the kind of software project youâ€™re working on and tailored your approach appropriately?
- Are the requirements sufficiently well-defined and stable enough to begin construction (see the requirements checklist for details)?
- Is the architecture sufficiently well defined to begin construction (see the architecture checklist for details)?
- Have other risks unique to your particular project been addressed, such that construction is not exposed to more risk than necessary?
